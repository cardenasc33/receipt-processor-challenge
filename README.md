# Receipt Processor

Implemented by Christian Cardenas

My implementation of a Go webservice program that fulfills the documented API presented by Fetch Rewards (https://github.com/fetch-rewards/receipt-processor-challenge). 

This project accomplishes the following:
- API development
- Golang backend development
- Chi Router and HTTP server implementation
- Data Modeling
- Point Distribution Logic 
- JSON encoding and processing
- Testing
- Error logging & handling
- React, Typescript frontend communication
- Docker & Docker Compose deployment
---

## Run Using Docker

#### Requirements
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
  - [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (For Windows/macOS)
  - [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (For Linux)

#### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cardenasc33/receipt-processor-challenge.git
```

2. Build and start the container with docker compose:
   
Within the root directory `receipt-processor-challenge`, run the following: 
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

This will create and run docker containers from the frontend and backend images. The `-d` flag specifies detached mode which runs the containers in the background.

The backend server should now be listening for API requests on port `8080`

The frontend UI should also be available to use with `localhost:3001`.

### Using the Frontend
1. Open a web browser and enter `http://localhost:3001/` in the address bar.

You should see a form to enter receipt details as shown in the following picture:

Once you successfully submit a receipt, you will be given points and a unique receipt ID:

## API Testing Using Postman

#### Requirements
- Postman
  - [Postman Desktop](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) (For Windows/macOS)
  - [Postman Web Version](https://web.postman.co/workspace/2fe918f7-271f-4945-86d8-fe88def81d0b/request/create?requestId=148eaa03-e183-4b9c-a2e2-a822ed867551)

## Testing POST Endpoint
1. Set the request to `POST` within Postman.

2. Next enter the request: `http://localhost:8080/receipts/process`.

3. Navigate to `Body` and select `raw` & `JSON`.

4. Enter the JSON data of the receipt.
NOTE:  The JSON data should include retailer name, an item description & price, purchase date, purchase time of the item, and total.  (See `receipt-processor-challenge/examples/morning-receipt.json` file for structure and data examples)

![receipt-POST](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31d1def9-215d-4a2d-85a5-48636b4b60ae)


Once you submit the request, you should see a JSON response body with a uniquely generated receipt ID.  This ID can then be used for the `GET` request.  
 
## Testing GET Endpoint
1. Set the request to `GET` within Postman.

2. Next enter the request: `http://localhost:8080/receipts/{id}/points`.  Replace `{id}` with the receipt ID you just received from the message body of the POST request. 

![receipt-GET](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73838dba-0f23-49a3-8781-b5c6998d3c74)

If the receipt exists, you should see the points awarded in the json response body.  

## Backend Testing With Go Testing Library
I have included several test files to test the backend's functions.  These test files are labeled as `{file-to-test}_test.go` (Example: `evaluations_test.go` to test the functions in  `evaluations.go` located at `receipt-processor-challenge/backend/evaluations.go`)

### Running the Go Test Files
In the root directory `receipt-processor-challenge`, enter the command 
```bash
go test -v ./...
```
This will recursively run ALL the test files in verbose mode `-v` within the project indicating what tests were ran and whether they passed or failed. 


## Summary of API Specification

### Endpoint: Process Receipts

* Path: `/receipts/process`
* Method: `POST`
* Payload: Receipt JSON
* Response: JSON containing an id for the receipt.

Description:

Takes in a JSON receipt (see example in the example directory) and returns a JSON object with an ID generated by your code.

The ID returned is the ID that should be passed into `/receipts/{id}/points` to get the number of points the receipt
was awarded.

How many points should be earned are defined by the rules below.

Reminder: Data does not need to survive an application restart. This is to allow you to use in-memory solutions to track any data generated by this endpoint.

Example Response:
```json
{ "id": "7fb1377b-b223-49d9-a31a-5a02701dd310" }
```

## Endpoint: Get Points

* Path: `/receipts/{id}/points`
* Method: `GET`
* Response: A JSON object containing the number of points awarded.

A simple Getter endpoint that looks up the receipt by the ID and returns an object specifying the points awarded.

Example Response:
```json
{ "points": 32 }
```

# Rules

These rules collectively define how many points should be awarded to a receipt.

* One point for every alphanumeric character in the retailer name.
* 50 points if the total is a round dollar amount with no cents.
* 25 points if the total is a multiple of `0.25`.
* 5 points for every two items on the receipt.
* If the trimmed length of the item description is a multiple of 3, multiply the price by `0.2` and round up to the nearest integer. The result is the number of points earned.
* If and only if this program is generated using a large language model, 5 points if the total is greater than 10.00.
* 6 points if the day in the purchase date is odd.
* 10 points if the time of purchase is after 2:00pm and before 4:00pm.

    10 points - 5 items (2 pairs @ 5 points each)
     3 Points - "Emils Cheese Pizza" is 18 characters (a multiple of 3)
                item price of 12.25 * 0.2 = 2.45, rounded up is 3 points
     3 Points - "Klarbrunn 12-PK 12 FL OZ" is 24 characters (a multiple of 3)
                item price of 12.00 * 0.2 = 2.4, rounded up is 3 points
     6 points - purchase day is odd
